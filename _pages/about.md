👾 I received the PhD degree in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKSAR under the supervision of Prof. Prof. Kam Hung Ng. I obtained his B. Eng degree of engineering in mechanical engineering in the University of Hong Kong in 2015. His current research interests include system dynamics, nonlinear optimal control, trajectory optimization, and machine learning, with a special focus on their applications to autonomous aerial vehicles.

👾 If you find my work appealing or would like to [connect](mailto:yin-yuen.chan@connect.polyu.hk), please get in touch. I am always looking for new collaborations.
